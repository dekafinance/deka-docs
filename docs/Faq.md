### What is the DEKA protocol?
DEKA is a permissionless protocol allowing everyone to stake $DKA and earn instant upfront yield. Because of its permissionless nature, it will exist for as long as Binance Smart Chain does.

### How is the DEKA protocol useful?
The main benefit for the users is that they are not required to wait in order to get their yield. Instead, the yield is in their possession immediately. On the other hand, the yield can be redirected to either an externally owned account (EOA) or a contract. This opens an infinite amount of possibilities - from redirecting the instant yield to a friend or family member to a complex smart contract that can do further operations with it.

### Is the DEKA protocol fully permissionless?
Yes. The DEKA protocol pools/applications cannot be censored or whitelisted. Users cannot be censored or whitelisted. The DEKA team does not have the power to halt or edit the smart contracts in any way after they've been deployed. The contracts are not upgradeable, and there is no "backdoor" present in the code. Of course, the team has no control over the contracts of BEP20 tokens placed in the DEKA Protocol pools/applications.

### Does the DEKA protocol charge any fees at the protocol layer?
The users of the DEKA protocol will not be charged any fees. Instead, a percentage of the upfront yield will be "matched" and sent to a predefined wallet address. The match ratio can be as low as 0% and as high as 20%. That ratio can be changed via a three days time-lock function, so users can be aware if a change in the ratio is about to happen.

Example: If the match ratio is 5% and the generated upfront yield is 1,000 $DKA.
1,000 $DKA will be sent to the user, and 50 $DKA will be generated for the DEKA Team. The matched yield will be used to support future developments of The DEKA protocol. There are already plans to convert the organization into a DAO in the near future.

### Is there a DEKA protocol token?
Yes, there is a token called $DKA. The DEKA token does not have a fixed supply, and the contract address is **TBA**. Users can use the $DKA token to stake and earn instant upfront yield.

### Are there risks in using DEKA protocol?
DEKA protocol smart contracts have been designed with security as a top priority. The core protocol code has been reviewed, but we cannot guarantee that bugs won’t be found in the future.

The DEKA protocol contracts are not upgradeable (though other third-party pool implementations might be), and there aren’t any backdoors.

Remember that the tokens held in any of the DEKA applications are also smart contracts - not controlled by DEKA and may have their own risks. The DEKA protocol does not support non-BEP20-conforming tokens, but pools/applications may have been created that use them anyway.
